## Criterion

Given:
Retro runs before the librarian; `generate`, `render` and `sprint` tick the page, render and sprint lines after it (cases 226, 250).

When:
The person invokes `/retro`, and the agent counts the unticked `tasks` of the Spec.

Then:
A `create`, `update` or `defer` line of a page, a `guppi render` line and a `guppi sprint` line are listed as waiting for the librarian and end in none of the four ways; every other unticked line is debt, as today.
**－** Nothing else in Retro changes.

## Result

2026-09-20, the first live /retro after the render of commit 3e1251f, read by hand: the unticked lines of raw/2026-09-20/0527/spec.md counted per Case — the create, update and defer lines of pages and the uv run guppi render line listed as waiting for the librarian, ending in none of the four ways; the three read lines counted as debt or taken; nothing else of Retro changed
